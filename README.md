## <a name="Practical_work_1"> Practical work 1 - Development of an expert system in the logic programming language - PROLOGUE </a>

More information can be found from the *docx* report. The program code in the **prolog language** and the report can be found here "[Practical work 1](./Practical%20work%201/)".

## <a name="Practical_work_2"> Practical work 2 - Development of an expert system based on Bayesian inference</a>

The theory of the **Bayesian formula** is well presented in the *ipynb* file. This file also has a task and its implementation. You can find it here "[Practical work 2](./Practical%20work%202/)".

## <a name="Basic_machine_learning_algorithms"> Basic machine learning algorithms</a>

### <a name="Practical_work_5"> Practical work 5 - Regression analysis</a>

The solution of the ***regression problem*** using **linear and polynomial regression of various degrees** can be found here "[Practical work 5](./Practical%20work%205/)".

### <a name="Practical_work_6"> Practical work 6 - Classification task</a>

Solving the ***classification problem*** using various machine learning algorithms. Implemented **The k-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN)**, **Decision tree algorithm**, **Logistic regression algorithm**. Optimal hyperparameters are also searched for the selected datasets. This is contained in "[Practical work 6](./Practical%20work%206/)".

### <a name="Practical_work_7"> Practical work 7 - Cluster analysis </a>

Solving the ***clustering problem*** using the **k-means algorithm**. The implementation of the **k-means algorithm (k-means++)** and the implementation of the "elbow" method for determining the optimal number of clusters is contained in "[Practical work 7](./Practical%20work%207/)".

## <a name="Practical_work_8"> Practical work 8 - Compositions of machine learning algorithms</a>

The ***classification problem*** is solved using **ensemble methods** by **Random Forest algorithm** and **AdaBoost algorithm algorithms**. Optimal hyperparameters are also searched for the selected datasets. This is contained in "[Practical work 8](./Practical%20work%208/)".

Ensemble methods are implemented:
- Bagging -> **Random Forest algorithm**;
- Boosting -> **AdaBoost algorithm**.
